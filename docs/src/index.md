# SpikingNeuralNetwork.jl Documentation


## Overview

Spiking Neural Network is a library for simulation of biophysical network models. 

The library offers:
 - Modular, intuitive, and quick instantiation of complex biophysical models;
 - Flexible re-use of models already available and easy implementation of custom new models;
 - High performance and native multi-threading support, laptop and cluster-friendly;
 - Easy access to models variables and parameters and save-load-rerun of arbitrarily complex networks. 

`SpikingNeuralNetworks.jl` is defined within the `JuliaSNN` ecosystem, which offers `SNNPlots` to plot models' recordings and `SNNUtils` for further stimulation protocols and analysis.

## Examples

A demonstration of how to instantiate a network model is found in [Models Examples](@ref)
